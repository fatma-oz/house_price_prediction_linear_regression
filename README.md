# house_price_prediction_lineer_regression

*In this data, the characteristics of each house are explained by giving 79 different variables. The aim of this study is to predict the sales price for each house. 

*The explanations of the variables are given at the beginning of the notebook.

*Among the variables, the 5 most significant variables were determined. First, a prediction model was created by choosing 2 variables, then another model was created with 5 variables.

*Jointplot and scatter plot from seaborn library were used for visualizations.

*The model was developed with linear regression.

*MAE, R2_SCORE, MSE AND RMSE are taken into account in the predict results.

*Developed the model and achieved 80% success with R2_SCORE.

*House price prediction data set is used.(kaggle competiton dataset)
